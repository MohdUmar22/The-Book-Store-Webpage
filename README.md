# The-Book-Store-Webpage
Here I have done the frontend part to develop the webpage for a "Bookstore".
It includes First Page, The Product Page and The Cart Page.
First Page Name= BookHub.html
Product Page Name= Products.html
Cart Page Name= Cart.html
And at last, the CSS named as "style.css"

I have also uploaded all the images used in developing the page. I am unable to deal with the backend part, as I'm skilled only for the frontends.
Thank You
